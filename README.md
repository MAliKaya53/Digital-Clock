# ðŸ•’ Digital Clock (FPGA - VHDL)

This project is a **digital clock** design that runs on FPGA. It displays the hour, minute, and second information on **four 7-segment displays**.  
In addition, functions such as setting the hour and minute and resetting are supported via buttons.

## ðŸ“œ Project Summary

This project is a synchronous digital clock designed using **VHDL**.  
The design is modular and can be synthesized in **Xilinx Vivado / Quartus** environments.  
All inputs are processed debounced (vibration-free).

**Key Features:**
- 24-hour format
- Hour and minute adjustment via buttons
- Reset function
- Debounce filtering
- Time display on a 4-digit 7-segment display
